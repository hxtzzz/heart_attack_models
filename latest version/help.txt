This program helps people use neural network to get their predictions of chance of heart attack.

Input Information
age - Age of the patient 
sex - Sex of the patient 
cp - Chest pain type ~ 0 = Typical Angina, 1 = Atypical Angina, 2 = Non-anginal Pain, 3 = Asymptomatic 
trtbps - Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
chol - Cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor 
fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) ~ 1 = True, 0 = False  
restecg - Resting electrocardiographic results ~ 0 = Normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = Left ventricular hypertrophy
thalachh - Maximum heart rate achieved
oldpeak - Previous peak
slp – Slope of the highest moving ST segment (0 uphill, 1 flat, 2 downhill)
caa - Number of major vessels （0~4）
thall - A blood disease called thalassemia (normal; Fixed defect; Reversible defect  (1 normal, 2 fixed defect, 3 reversible defect) 
exng - Exercise induced angina ~ 1 = Yes, 0 = No 

output information
0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
